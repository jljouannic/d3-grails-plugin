D3.js Grails plugin
===

D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for manipulating data and bring it to life using HTML, SVG and CSS.

This plugin simply provides a resource file for d3.js.

Installation
---

Edit `BuildConfig.groovy` and add the following plugin dependency:

```Groovy
runtime ":d3:3.4.1.0"
```

###Version number

The version number of this plugin follows the version number of the D3.js version it bundles, with possible 4th-level point releases for patches/iterations of the plugin with the same D3.js library.

For example, the first release of this plugin is 3.4.1.0 because it provides D3.js 3.4.1. If there was a problem with this release, this might change to 3.4.1.1, 3.4.1.2, etc.

Usage
---

This plugin provides a `D3Resources.groovy` file in which a `d3` module is defined.
Now, thanks to the Grails resources plugin, declaring a dependency to the D3.js library can be done by adding the following in GSP page header:

```html
<r:require modules="d3"/>
```

See [D3.js web site](http://d3js.org/) for documentation and many great examples to get you started.
